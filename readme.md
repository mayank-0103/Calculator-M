## How It Works  
The calculator uses a grid-based layout with buttons for numbers and operations. When a button is clicked, the corresponding value is appended to the display. The calculation is performed using JavaScript's `eval()` function when the equals button is pressed.  

### Positioning Features  
The calculator now comes with **four** positioning options:  
1. **Center Calculator**: Places the calculator in the center of the screen  
2. **Revert Back**: Returns the calculator to its original position  
3. **Change Position by px**: Allows the user to input custom x and y coordinates  

## Installation
